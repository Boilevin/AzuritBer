/*      
 *      DUE and ODOMETRY MANDATORY VERSION 
 *      PCB1.3 
 *      COMPATIBLE WITH THIS IMU 
 *      GY-88 CONNECTED ON I2C2 IMU
 *      GY-521 with compass deactivate CONNECTED ON I2C2 IMU
 *      GY-521 CONNECTED ON I2C2 IMU + GY-273 CONNECTED ON I2C3 DISPLAY with compass activate
 *      SO IT'S MPU6050 and HMC5883L or QMC5883L
 *      
 *      Connect DUE programming port to PC for programming and PC console
 *      Connect DUE Native USB port to Raspberry Pi 
 *      
 *      During all test and dev set Enable_DueWatchdog to false
 *      or increase the delay in robot.cpp line : watchdogEnable(3000);// Watchdog trigger after  3 sec if not reseted.
 *      
 *      -------------------------- BT or ESP8266 --------------------------------------------------
 *      Into mower.cpp line 255 select correct configuration
 *       bluetoothUse      = 1;      // use Bluetooth module? It's Impossible to use Bluetooth and esp8266 at same time
 *       esp8266Use        = 0;       // use ESP8266 Wifi module?
 *      
 *      ------------------------- RTC CHIP -------------------------------------------------------
 *      Into mower.h line 163 Select the correct RTC.
 *      #define AT24C32_ADDRESS B1010000 //0x50 //Standard PCB1.3 RTC ds1307 memory module
 *      //#define AT24C32_ADDRESS B1010111 //0x57 //Simple PCB RTC ds3231 memory module
 *      
 *     
 *      ------------------------------ RASPBERRY -------------------------------------------------
 *      If Raspberry PI is not connected you need to change into mower.h
 *          #define Console Serial
 *          //#define Console SerialUSB
 *      and into arduremote setting Raspberry set raspberryPiuse to NO
 *      then you have access to the Console on the PC 
 *      
 *      If Raspberry PI is connected you need to change into mower.h
 *          //#define Console Serial
 *          #define Console SerialUSB
 *      and into arduremote setting R/C set raspberryPiuse to YES
